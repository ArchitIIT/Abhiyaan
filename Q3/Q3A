Strategies for a 3v3 football match:

Formation Selection:
    1. 1-1-1 (Flat Formation): Each player covers one area of the field, with one player acting as the goalkeeper, one in midfield, and one as the forward.
    2. 2-0-1 (Triangle Formation): One player acts as the goalkeeper while the other two players form a triangle, with one player in midfield and the other as the forward. This formation allows for quick passing and support.
    3. 1-0-2 (Defensive Formation): One player acts as the goalkeeper, while the other two players play forward. This formation focuses on defensive solidity while relying on counterattacks for scoring opportunities.
    4. 0-2-1 (Wing Formation): Both players act as forwards, with one player positioned centrally and the other on the wing. The remaining player acts as the goalkeeper. This formation focuses on attacking through the wings and quick transitions.


Path Planning:
    1. Dynamic Path Planning: Continuously update paths in real-time based on the latest information about the game environment, such as the positions of players and the ball. This approach allows for more flexibility and adaptability to changes during the match.
    2. Potential Field Methods: Model the field as a potential field where attractive forces guide robots towards the goal while repulsive forces help avoid obstacles and other robots. This approach is intuitive and computationally efficient.
    3. Machine Learning-Based Approaches: Train machine learning models to learn optimal paths based on historical data from previous matches or simulations. Reinforcement learning techniques can also be used to adaptively improve path planning strategies over time.
    4. Hierarchical Planning: Divide the field into zones and plan paths at different levels of abstraction, such as high-level strategic planning and low-level local navigation. This hierarchical approach allows for efficient planning at multiple scales.
    5. Multi-Agent Coordination: Coordinate the paths of multiple robots to ensure they work together effectively as a team. This may involve communication between robots to share information and synchronize movements.
